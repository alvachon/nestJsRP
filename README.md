Simulating a NestJS structure from scratch

# Steps so far
1. Creating a directory named **myapp**, cd in.
2. ``npm init -y``  --> Create a package.json, that represent an empty nodejs project.
3. Installing the core and supporting files (with npm or yarn) withthe command ``npm -i --save @nestjs/core @nestjs/common rxjs reflect-metadata`` as cited in https://docs.nestjs.com/
